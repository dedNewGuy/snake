# Snake | That Classic Game

This is just bare minimum gameplay for snake. No fancy stuff. It
originally just to start me going to code again by gaining that momentum.
I'll do my best to improve my mental health.

## Build

**Requirements**

- SDL2
- make
- gcc

```
make all
```

It will generate `snake` executable. You can run it with
```
make run
or
./snake
```
